## Simple REST API Example

A simple REST API powered by Spring Boot and Swagger to allow clients to
add and retrieve products from an in-memory collection.

To run this application, you can either:

1. Head to the Releases page and download and run the JAR:
**java -jar products-api-kr-1.0.jar**
2. Or, if you prefer, you can download the source and run 
**mvn spring-boot:run** from the project's root directory

Once running, you can test the API using your own HTTP client, or you
can use the built-in Swagger UI at the following URL:
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
