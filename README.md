## Simple REST API Example

A simple REST API powered by Spring Boot and Swagger to allow clients to
add and retrieve products from an in-memory collection.

To run this application, you can either:

1. Clone the repository and call **mvn spring-boot:run** from the root
folder, or
2. Download and run the fat JAR:
**java -jar products-api-kr-1.0.jar**

Once running, you can test the API using your own HTTP client, or you
can use the built-in Swagger UI at the following URL:
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
